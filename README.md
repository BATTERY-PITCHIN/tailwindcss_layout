You can set Tailwind's develop environment by entering a following link

LINK : https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app


And then you have to install some modules.

>>npm install react-router-dom@5

Currently "react-router-dom" is released Version.6
However we will use Version.5 since it has some issues with Version.6.
